<h2 style="text-align: center;">Property Accessors (#2)</h2><p>Implement a strange property <code>accesses</code> which counts how many times this
property was accessed.  Note that it returns a new value each time.</p>
<div class='hint'>Introduce an auxiliary `private` property to store the value and
increment this value in a getter of the `accesses` property on each access. The
Kotlin style guide recommends naming such auxiliary property starting with an
underscore: `_accesses`.
