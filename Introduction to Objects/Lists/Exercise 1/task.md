## Lists (#1)

The Kotlin standard library contains many functions to work with lists.
However, it's still a good exercise to implement some of them by hand.

Find the maximum value in a list of natural numbers. If the list is empty,
return zero.

The function `findMax()` takes `IntList` as an argument. `IntList` is a toy
class that only allows you to iterate over a list's contents, get its size and
access elements by index.
