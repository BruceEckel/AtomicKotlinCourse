## Hello, World! (#2)

Display the same phrase "Hello, Kotlin!" on the console, but "Kotlin" should
appear on the next line. You can display two separate strings to achieve that:

```
Hello,
Kotlin!
```

Try replacing `println()` with `print()` and see what changes.

Note that tests for all following exercises in this book assume that you use
`println()`, not `print()`, as a default way to display the data on the
console.
