<body><h2>Inheritance (#1)</h2><p><code>MazeImpl</code> keeps record of positions of all the elements added to <code>ElementMatrix</code>
by storing a map from an element to position.</p><p>The logic reading the maze was moved from its representation to <code>MazeImpl</code> 
class, so that information about elements was added correctly to both
<code>matrix</code> and <code>elementToPosition</code> Map. Edit it if necessary by using 
the private member function <code>addElement()</code>.</p><p>Implement the <code>destroyElement()</code> function which should remove the element both
from <code>matrix</code> and from the auxiliary <code>elementToPosition</code> map.</p></body>
