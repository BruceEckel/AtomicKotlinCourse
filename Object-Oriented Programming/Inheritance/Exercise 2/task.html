<body><h2>Inheritance (#2)</h2><p>Implement a more powerful version of the bomb: the one with a diameter of 
the explosion. All the cells that are close enough to the bomb except walls
must be destroyed. Walls are strong enough not to be exploded.</p><p>Note that the bomb should explode only when another element steps at the same 
cell.</p><p>Use the auxiliary function <code>isCloseToBomb()</code> to check whether an element
is close enough to the bomb to be destroyed.</p></body>
