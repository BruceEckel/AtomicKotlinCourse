<body><h2>Interfaces (#1)</h2><p><code>ElementsMatrix</code> is an auxiliary interface used to implement <code>MazeImpl</code>.
It stores elements in a two-dimensional list of the size <code>height * width</code>,
which is implemented as a list of Lists (where the outer list is of <code>height</code> 
size and each inner list is of <code>width</code> size).</p><p>In each cell a set of elements is stored. It's possible to add or remove a given 
element in a specified position. Your task is to implement <code>addElement()</code> and
 <code>removeElement()</code> functions.</p><p>The sample shows the representation of elements stored in <code>matrix</code>.</p><p>Especially for the tasks in this section, make sure you add your solution only
inside the answer box, in this way, the following tasks will be able to correctly
reuse it.</p></body>
